# What is it?


launssh is a small Java application whose sole purpose in life is to launch
an SSH

client on your system. It can be packaged as either a Java applet or a Java
Web Start

(JNLP) application. It works on all three major platforms (Linux, MacOS,
Windows) and

knows about a number of SSH client applications.


Launching an SSH client is a seemingly simple task that is actually quite
difficult

to accomplish once you account for all of the different clients, their
differing command

lines and key formats, and the wide selection of terminal applications
available across

various OSes.


## How is launssh licensed?


The launssh source code is MIT-licensed; please consult LICENSE.md for more
details.


The bulk of launssh development and support are a personal effort on the
part of myself,

Tony Spataro, the copyright holder of launssh. The source code bears some
references to

RightScale, Inc. since I originally developed the application for use with
my employer's

Web application; however, RightScale maintains a fork of the project which
is customized

for their needs and is unaffiliated with the open-source launssh product.


I am in the process of removing RightScale branding from the application
and its support

files, and v1.0 will feature neutrally-branded assets (along with numerous
other improvements!)


# How do I use it?


For the time being, consult the examples under test/integration. Still need
to produce a real README...
